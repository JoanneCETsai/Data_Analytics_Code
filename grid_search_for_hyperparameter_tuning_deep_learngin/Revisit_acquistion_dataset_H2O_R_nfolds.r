#h2o grid search function: 

# The following command on lines 32-38 is very computationally intensive.
# It involves using 1366 observations to fit 2*4*4*2*2 = 128 models.
# Consequently, this is too much for this browser version of Rstudio to handle
# so instead we have included the results of h2o.grid() for you.
# Just run line 40 below to load the data and you will be able to then 
# print the results

# We encourage you to experiment with h2o on your personal computer!
