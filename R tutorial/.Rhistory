# The function c() creates a string of values,
# and the line below also assigns that string to x:
x <- c(1:5, 15)
x    # x is now the vector 1 2 3 4 5 15
# Let's find the mean of x. We can use the function mean to do this:
mean(x)
#### We can use R documentation to see how the function mean() works, by entering
?mean
